Solar System Simulation by Dan Hodgin and Savoy Schuler (2016)


Display Notes
-------------
Planetary orbits are scaled by a constant factor of 1.0/37.5 to maintain a ratio
of relative distance.

All planets, except the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, are scaled by a constant 
factor of 1.0/15945.0.  

The Sun is displayed at 1/10 its actual size.

Jupiter and Saturn are displayed at 50% actual size.
